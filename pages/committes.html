              </h1>
              <p>
                A persistent question emerges when the oppressed's hope for justice flutters in their hearts. Can there be true justice when the winners set the terms for it? Like the convicts whose ambition has bound them, the champions of human rights frequently bear the burden of those who have prevailed.
                Self-interested, victorious people may ignore their own wrongdoings and concentrate only on the enemies they have defeated. This selectiveness produces a terrifying reality in which the very instruments designed to protect fundamental rights end up serving as tools of a distorted judicial system, permanently wounding the struggle for a better future.
                Is it possible for this distinguished assembly, committed to the principles of Jus Gentium, or The Law of Nations, to shatter these bonds and guarantee that justice extends beyond the winner's narrative.  The world watches, for within these halls lies the potential to ignite a beacon of hope for a future illuminated by universal justice.

              <p>
                Geopolitically, the South China Sea is simmering, on the verge of exploding. Multi-nation claims to fragile islands serve as the focal point of a high-stakes maritime Monopoly game. The UN Security Council is not present to see this titanic struggle from the sidelines.
                The global commerce artery, freedom of navigation, is at risk of being clogged. Attempting to exert control unilaterally is like setting off a grenade in this delicate circumstance. We demand that all sides forgo the battleships and use diplomacy instead. By promoting communication and respect for international law, the UN Security Council can serve as a life preserver during this storm and guarantee a peaceful conclusion. Together, let's negotiate these dangerous waters before a minor altercation turns into a major conflict.

              <p>
                In the vast expanse of the global agricultural landscape, the ongoing farmers' protest resonates as a poignant reminder of the challenges faced by agricultural communities worldwide. This grassroots movement, which emerged from the shared opinions and goals of farmers worldwide, cuts across national boundaries and addresses fundamental concerns about fair trade, ethical farming, and rural communities' means of livelihood. The demonstration transforms into a powerful representation of strength and resistance as tractors fill the streets and voices increase in support, pressuring decision-makers and other interested parties to pay attention and take action. Essentially, the protest by the farmers highlights the pressing need for genuine solutions, empathy, and discourse to address the systemic injustices and inequalities that are present in agricultural systems all over the world. It is an appeal for action to defend the rights.

              <p>
                Amidst the shadows cast by the National Emergency, two constitutional milestones emerged, forever etching their significance in India's democratic journey. Born in the furnace of struggle, the 43rd and 44th Amendments serve as monuments to persistence and change. The former, in response to the challenges created by the Emergency, attempted to restore fundamental rights and counterbalance governmental power. Meanwhile, the latter, created with a historical perspective, strengthened democratic values and protected individual liberty. As we convene to reflect on these chapters in our constitutional history, we commemorate the spirit of democracy and the unwavering pursuit of justice.

              <p>
                Like a shadow looming over the tapestry of human relations, marital rape stains the sanctity of intimacy. As consciousness fades, questions arise: Is the eradication of marital rape an inevitable societal evolution or a perpetuation of silence? Amidst the darkness, a glimmer of hope emerges—a call for accountability and change. Voices of survivors and advocates echo, demanding recognition and justice. Yet, progress remains elusive, obscured by the complexities of cultural norms and legal barriers.As we navigate the tumultuous waters of societal evolution, let us not falter in our commitment to justice and equality. Let us stand shoulder to shoulder with survivors, amplifying their voices and advocating for systemic reform. Together, we must challenge the societal constructs that perpetuate violence and oppression within intimate relationships

              <p>
                Decades of drug warfare have left a human devastation in their wake. The UNODC suggests switching to controlled legalization in exchange for a ceasefire. Imagine a well-lit pharmacy with age verification and quality control taking the place of a criminal bazaar. Legalization destroys criminal networks, raises tax income to combat addiction, and substitutes safe pharmaceuticals for tainted ones.
                <br>
                Though some people worry about an increase in use, legalization isn't a free-for-all. Compare it to cigarettes in that it is controlled, subject to taxes, and surrounded by anti-smoking campaigns. Not with closed fists, but with open discourse, is what the UNODC calls for. One educated discussion at a time, let's discard the outdated tactics of the past and construct a healthy future, piece by piece, through evidence-based policies.

                In the ever-evolving landscape of human rights discourse, the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) finds itself at the forefront of addressing one of the most pressing issues of our time: police brutality. Imagine a scene where a complex web of power dynamics, societal expectations, and institutional biases intersect on the streets, where the guardians of law and order wield immense authority. Yet, all too often, this authority is misused, resulting in instances of violence, discrimination, and injustice. The agenda of tackling police brutality is akin to unraveling a gripping mystery, delving deep into the complexities of human behavior, systemic flaws, and the delicate balance between security and civil liberties. In this mission, the UNHRC shines as a symbol of hope, sparking talks, building understanding, and driving real change toward a world where uniforms mean fairness and safety for everyone, not just power.

              <p>
                Like the ebb and flow of tides in the vast expanse of the ocean, the past decade of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) governance has witnessed a whirlwind of triumphs, tribulations, and transformations. Has the BJP's stewardship steered India towards a new dawn of progress and prosperity, or have the promises of development been lost in the turbulent waters of political turmoil? As electoral victories punctuate the political landscape, one wonders: has the BJP charted a course towards a brighter future, or are we adrift in a sea of uncertainty? Amidst the waves of economic reforms and social upheavals, have the voices of the marginalized found resonance, or have they been drowned out by the cacophony of power struggles? As the BJP's tenure unfurls, one cannot help but ponder: is this era a beacon of hope for the nation, or merely a fleeting mirage on the horizon of history?
